Hi Manikandan,

Please find the transaction details.
In below screenshot, Billing Amount of 361.79 USD has been debited twice from my account. 361.79 USD is equivalent of 1500 RM.
I have done all the transaction (1500 RM Amount)  on Friday 25-Aug-2017 but I am finding some entries are showing up on 26-Aug-2017 with transaction reversed and settled.
So, please do check with HDFC bank to verify and reverse the transaction amount of 361.79 USD which is debited twice.

Please let me know if you have any concerns.

CARD NUMBER: 4213 3103 0367 0309
